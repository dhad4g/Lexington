The GPro 2 (Saratoga) is the second generation of RISC-V processors designed by
[Gerber Prototyping](https://g-proto.com). Intended both FPGA implementation and
physical design. Saratoga adds a 5-stage pipeline to the previous generation
GPro 1 (Lexington). This processor is currently in the initial design phase as
the focus of a Graduate Independent Study course.

## Features

- RV32IM instruction set
- Modified-Harvard architecture
- 4k instruction and data caches
- Machine-mode and User-mode
- 5-stage pipeline
  - data forwarding
  - speculative execution
  - Low-overhead exception handling

## Pipeline

The pipeline design can be found in [docs/Pipeline.md](./docs/Pipeline.md).
